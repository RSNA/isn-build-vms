# isn-build-vms/upgrade_from_4.0
These scripts upgrade a 4.0 Edge Server to the 5.0 version.
You will need two folders that are not stored in the git repository because
of their size:
+ other_files
+ torquebox-3.2.0
You will also need to run the scripts in isn-build-vms/5.0-scripts to change
file permissions and configure the database properly. Run those scripts
after you run the scripts in this folder.
